## Hey there!

This is a quick implementation of the very popular [TodoMVC app](http://todomvc.com/). Wrote in typescript, it demonstrates how to use React with MobX (typescript decorators) to manage state.

## Further Work / Exercises

- Tie in a routing module with MobX
- Persist to [HTML5 Web Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
- User/Password Authentication (Guest or Registered)
